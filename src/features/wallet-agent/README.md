# CongChain Wallet Agent

This module defines the safety contract for future wallet automation.

The product rule is intentionally strict:

- CongChain may interpret, prepare, simulate, schedule, and notify.
- CongChain may not move funds by itself.
- Every value-moving action must require an explicit wallet signature.
- Scheduled actions must be confirmed in-app first and approved again by wallet at execution time.
- Privacy features must protect user metadata without bypassing user consent.

Phase 1 is policy only. No swap, payment, payroll, or signing flow is executed here.
